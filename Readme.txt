SM127 Code Converter- Made by Cass Star, coded in Java

What it Does:

	This program converts SM127 level codes between game versions 0.6.1 and 0.7.2 exclusively.

	You can try to use it to convert between other versions, but the program will probably give you
		an error complaining about an invalid code version, and I haven't tested any of the
		other versions, so expect bugs if you try that.

Important:

	This program requires a not-ancient version of Java installed in order to run. If you do not
		have Java installed or have a Java version less than 14.0.0, please install Java/
		update your installation before running the program. You can find which version of Java
		you have installed by running 'java -version' from the command line. Java can be
		downloaded from https://www.java.com/download

	Do NOT delete 'Converter.jar', 'Converter.java', or the 'input' and 'output' folders!
		The program expects them to exist and will not be able to run without them.

	You CAN safely delete the 'info' folder, it's not used by the program,
		it's just for documentation purposes.

Usage:

	1. Put all the files you want to convert into the 'input' folder

	2. Run 'Converter.bat', you may or may not be able to see the file extension based on your
		system's settings
	
	2a. If 'Converter.bat' gives you an error when you try running it, try instead to run
		'Converter2.bat'

	3. Follow the directions the program tells you to do

	4. Converted files will be put in the 'output' folder, check it once the program finishes

	5. Remember to clear out the 'input' folder between uses of the program,
		it will try to convert every text file it finds in that folder
