Added support for converting levels made in 0.8.0
The program will now ask which game version a level was made in if it cannot determine it from the level code version (should be the case for most versions aside from 0.7.0)
The process of converting level data between versions has been seperated to individual files based on what version the level comes from
Background palletes now have a greater effect during the conversion process, when relevant
Finally fixed the area Re-arranger functionality! You can now place areas above, below, and all around each other without stuff breaking :)
