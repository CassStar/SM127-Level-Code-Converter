Object properties represented by integers in-game are now represented by longs in-code, since these values can sometimes be too large/small to fit in an integer
Once again fixed a bug in the level re-arranger where tiles would be misplaced, hopefully for the last time
The level re-arranger now better handles levels with an amount of areas greater than 10, and theoretically greater than 100 too, up to a max of 999 areas
The level re-arranger now stops you from creating a level that exceeds the size limits of the level editor
All objects now have default values which will be used if no value is provided by the level code
Normalized most object names so that they are better grouped according to what type of object they are
